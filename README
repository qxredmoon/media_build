-This is an experimental build system for media drivers.
-All files on this tree are covered by GPLv2, as stated at COPYING file.
+This was an experimental build system for media drivers, allowing media drivers
+from mainline to be backported to older kernels.
 
-Usage:
+However, to maintain this took too much time and effort for little gain. Few
+if any new PCI(e) or USB drivers have been added to mainline in a long time,
+almost all effort is happening for embedded systems.
 
-Just call the build utility:
-	$ ./build
+In addition, it was only compile tested, and not whether it would actually work.
 
-Then, install the drivers as root, with:
-	# make install
+So the decision was made to stop maintaining this.
 
-In order to test, unload old drivers with:
-	# make rmmod
+If someone would want to take over maintainership, then post a message to the
+linux-media@vger.kernel.org mailinglist.
 
-Then modprobe the driver you want to test. For example, to load driver 'foo':
-	# modprobe foo
-
-
-If you're developing a new driver or patch, it is better to use:
-	$ ./build --main-git
-
-Then, install the drivers as root, with:
-	# make install
-
-In order to test, unload old drivers with:
-	# make rmmod
-
-Then modprobe the driver you want to test. For example:
-	# modprobe bttv
-
-In this case, in order to modify something, you should edit the file at
-the media/ subdir.
-
-For example, a typical procedure to develop a new patch would be:
-
-	~/media_build $ cd media
-	~/media $ gedit drivers/media/video/foo.c
-	~/media $ make -C ../v4l
-	~/media $ make -C .. rmmod
-	~/media $ modprobe foo
-	(some procedure to test the "foo" driver)
-	~/media $ git diff >/tmp/my_changes.patch
-	(email /tmp/my_changes.patch inlined to linux-media@vger.kernel.org)
